# Statistical Methods for Machine Learning Project
The main purpose of this project is to provide funtionalities for the image (binary) classification with different neural network structures and hyper-parameters in particular the multi-layered and convolutional neural network. 

## Preprocessing
Functionalities to handle input data (images), modify and clean them

## DataAugmentation
Functionalities to create new copies of the data (images) with modifies features

## Models
Functionalities to build and compile parametrized models (MLNN and CNN)

## Utils
Functionalities with different purposes:
- Plotting and visualization of the results
- Result saving
- Validation functions (Nested cross and five fold cross validation)
